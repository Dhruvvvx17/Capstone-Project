# Capstone-Project
Capstone Project (Sem-7 and Sem-8) in Data Science, PES University


We wish to bring forward a product that will help the farmers of our country decide which crops to grow on their farms so as to maximise the earnings at the time of harvest.
The final completed product will help the farmers of rural India decide which crops to invest in, aiming towards a better yield. This product aims to help reduce the imbalance between the supply and demand, prevalent in the country.
The product will help predict the best possible crops based on the estimated overall profit that will be earned by the farmer for the suggested crop(s). 
Our product will work on most platforms that support python, with a basic UI to show a working prototype for our product.
Based on the trends observed, our project aims to forecast the yields of the crops grown in our country, aiding the farmers to take insightful decisions on choosing the appropriate crops to grow on their land, thereby reducing the aforementioned imbalance.
