Points of Importance:

1. Introduction

"...compute an overall measure of relative vegetation health compared to the mean on a per-pixel basis over select subregions in every African country, thus evaluating whether dense farmingareas can be used as representative samples of larger regions to increase computational efficiency. ...it does not depend on special tuning for the particular crop, region, or climate of interest."

"Relatively low-resolution pixels of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) decrease the amount of data that must be processed, making this system cheaper and more efficient"

"Crop masks are not used in this model"

The goal : "see how well crop yields may be predicted using extremely straightforward methods based on simple averages and differences of common indices over dense farming regions and the resulting correlations"

"The index developed here is similar to Vegetation Condition Index (VCI)"
